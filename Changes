      o Fields must now be marked as "highlightable" at index time via
        their FieldType.
      o Excerpts are now created manually rather than automatically inserted

        fetch_doc() - added.

    * KinoSearch::Search::SortSpec
      o new() - takes new param "rules", an array of SortRules.
      o add() - removed.

    * KinoSearch::Search::TermQuery
      o new() - now takes "field", and "term" (which is a string rather than a
        Term object as before).

    * KinoSearch::Searcher

        IndexReader object), rather than "invindex" or "reader".

      o collect(), doc_max(), doc_freq(), fetch_doc(), get_schema() - added.

  Subclassing improvements:

    * Although KinoSearch is now implemented almost entirely in C, pure-Perl
      dynamic subclassing is supported.  (Public methods which are overridden
      in pure-Perl subclasses are automatically detected and invoked as
      callbacks by the the internal KS object engine.)

  Significant internal changes:

    * All classes now implemented in C, with Perl and XS only where necessary.
    * Doc IDs now start at 1 rather than 0.

0.20_01 2007-02-26
  
  KinoSearch 0.20 is a major rewrite, adding many new features.  It also
  breaks backwards compatibility in a number of ways.  
  
  Two key features, UTF-8 support and custom sorting, were not possible to
  implement while preserving backwards compatibility.  Once the decision was
  made to proceed with them, breaking all existing installations, it made
  little sense to proceed by half measures, so the API has been given a
  significant overhaul.

  KinoSearch has always carried an "alpha code" warning; it is being invoked
  for this release.  While it will continue to carry the "alpha" warning for
  a short while longer, the point of jamming so many changes into one release
  is to cause disruption only once; once the code in 0.20 proves itself,
  hopefully no more backwards incompatible changes will be needed any time
  soon.

  New behaviors:

    * KinoSearch now uses UTF-8 for all input and output, throughout the
      entire library.  This affects many classes, but particularly those under
      Analysis, Highlight, and QueryParser.
    * The default scoring algorithm has changed subtly -- aggressive 
      per-field boosting is no longer important or even desirable.  The old
      behavior is available from KinoSearch::Contrib::LongFieldSim.

  New public classes:

    * KinoSearch::Schema
    * KinoSearch::Schema::FieldSpec
    * KinoSearch::InvIndex
    * KinoSearch::Analysis::Token
    * KinoSearch::Search::RangeFilter
    * KinoSearch::Search::SortSpec
    * KinoSearch::Search::Similarity
    * KinoSearch::Contrib::LongFieldSim

        removed. 

  Internal changes:

    Large-scale refactoring has taken place.  The most significant 
    changes are...

    * OO framework imposed on C code via boilerplater.pl, with
      KinoSearch::Util::Obj as the base class.
    * Charmonizer added.
    * perlapi functions and data structures replaced whenever possible.
    * Lots of classes, especially under KinoSearch::Index, reorganized around
      Schema and SegInfo.  
    * Many tests added, removed, or revised to accomodate changes in the main
      library code.
    * C code moved to dedicated files.
    * Build.PL custom code moved to buildlib/KinoSearchBuild.pm
  
  File Format:

    * Significantly redesigned.  The most visible change is that the segments
      file is now encoded using YAML rather than an arbitrary binary format.
    * Old indexes cannot be read and must be regenerated.

  Locking

    * write.lock files now located in the index directory rather than 
      under /tmp.
    * Commit locks are no longer needed due to file format changes.
    * Stale write locks are now removed without warning.

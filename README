KinoSearch

Search engine library.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    perl Build
    perl Build test
    perl Build install

Module::Build is required.  Since Perl 5.10.0, Module::Build has been bundled
with the Perl core, but on older systems it may be necessary to install it
from CPAN first.

XS CODE

KinoSearch is a Perl/XS distribution, despite the apparent lack of .xs 
files -- KinoSearch.xs gets written on the fly during the build.

/** Suppress a "stoplist" of common words.
 * 
 * A "stoplist" is collection of "stopwords": words which are common enough to
 * be of little value when determining search results.  For example, so many
 * documents in English contain "the", "if", and "maybe" that it may improve
 * both performance and relevance to block them.
 * 
 * Before filtering stopwords:
 * 
 *     ( "i", "am", "the", "walrus" ) 
 *     
 * After filtering stopwords:
 * 
 *     ( "walrus" );
 *
 * Stopalizer provides default stoplists for several languages, courtesy of
 * the Snowball project (<http://snowball.tartarus.org>), or you may supply
 * your own.

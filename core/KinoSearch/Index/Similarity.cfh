/** Judge how well a document matches a query.
 * 
 * After determining whether a document matches a given query, a score must be
 * calculated which indicates how I<well> the document matches the query.  The
 * Similarity class is used to judge how "similar" the query and the document
 * are to each other; the closer the resemblance, they higher the document
 * scores.
 * 
 * The default implementation uses Lucene's modified cosine similarity
 * measure.  Subclasses might tweak the existing algorithms, or might be used
 * in conjunction with custom Query subclasses to implement arbitrary scoring
 * schemes.
 * 
 * Most of the methods operate on single fields, but some are used to combine
 * scores from multiple fields.

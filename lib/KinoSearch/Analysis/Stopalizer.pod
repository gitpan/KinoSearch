=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Analysis::Stopalizer - Suppress a "stoplist" of common words.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $stopalizer = KinoSearch::Analysis::Stopalizer->new(
        language => 'fr',
    );
    my $polyanalyzer = KinoSearch::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer->new(
        analyzers => [ $case_folder, $tokenizer, $stopalizer, $stemmer ],
    );

This class uses Lingua::StopWords for its default stoplists, so it supports
the same set of languages.



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Suppress a "stoplist" of common words.

A "stoplist" is collection of "stopwords": words which are common enough to
be of little value when determining search results.  For example, so many
documents in English contain "the", "if", and "maybe" that it may improve
both performance and relevance to block them.

Before filtering stopwords:

    ( "i", "am", "the", "walrus" ) 
    
After filtering stopwords:

    ( "walrus" );

Stopalizer provides default stoplists for several languages, courtesy of
the Snowball project (<http://snowball.tartarus.org>), or you may supply
your own.

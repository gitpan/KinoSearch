=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Docs::Tutorial - Step-by-step introduction to KinoSearch toolset.

=head1 ABSTRACT 

Explore KinoSearch's basic functionality by starting with a minimalist CGI
search app based on L<KSx::Simple> and transforming it, step by step, into an
"advanced search" interface utilizing more flexible core modules like
L<KinoSearch::Index::Indexer> and L<KinoSearch::Search::IndexSearcher>.

The source material used by the tutorial app -- an html presentation of the
United States constitution -- can be found in the C<sample>
directory at the root of the KinoSearch distribution, along with finished
indexing and search apps.

=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Index::DataReader - Abstract base class for reading index data.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Abstract base class.



=head1 DESCRIPTION

DataReader is the companion class to
L<DataWriter|KinoSearch::Index::DataWriter>.  Every index component will
implement one of each.

        schema   => $seg_reader->get_schema,      # default undef
        folder   => $seg_reader->get_folder,      # default undef
        snapshot => $seg_reader->get_snapshot,    # default undef
        segments => $seg_reader->get_segments,    # default undef
        seg_tick => $seg_reader->get_seg_tick,    # default -1

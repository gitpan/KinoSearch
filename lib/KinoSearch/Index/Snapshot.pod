=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Index::Snapshot - Point-in-time index file list.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $snapshot = KinoSearch::Index::Snapshot->new;
    $snapshot->read_file( folder => $folder );    # load most recent snapshot
    my $files = $snapshot->list;
    print "$_\n" for @$files;



=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Snapshot is list of index files.  Because index files, once written, are
never modified, the list of files in a Snapshot defines a point-in-time
view of the data in an index.

IndexReader objects interpret the data associated with a single Snapshot.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new()

    my $snapshot = KinoSearch::Index::Snapshot->new;

Constructor.  Takes no arguments.



=head1 METHODS

=head2 num_entries()

Return the number of entries (including directories).

=head2 add_entry(entry)

Add a filepath to the snapshot.

=head2 delete_entry(entry)

Delete a filepath from the snapshot.

Returns: true if the entry existed and was successfully deleted, false
otherwise.

=head2 read_file( I<[labeled params]> )

Decode a snapshot file and initialize the object to reflect its
contents.

B<folder> - A Folder.

B<filename> - The name of the snapshot file.  If not supplied, the
most recent snapshot file will be chosen.

exists.

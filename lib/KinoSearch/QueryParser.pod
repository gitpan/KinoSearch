=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::QueryParser - Transform a string into a Query object.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $query_parser = KinoSearch::QueryParser->new(
        schema => $searcher->get_schema,
        fields => ['body'],
    );
    my $query = $query_parser->parse( $query_string );
    my $hits  = $searcher->hits( query => $query );



=head1 DESCRIPTION

QueryParser accepts search strings as input and produces
L<KinoSearch::Search::Query> objects, suitable for feeding into
KinoSearch::Searcher and other L<Searchable|KinoSearch::Search::Searchable>
subclasses.

The following syntactical constructs are recognized by QueryParser:

    * Boolean operators 'AND', 'OR', and 'AND NOT'.
    * Prepented +plus and -minus, indicating that the labeled entity 
      should be either required or forbidden -- be it a single word, a 
      phrase, or a parenthetical group.
    * Logical groups, delimited by parentheses.  
    * Phrases, delimited by double quotes.

Additionally, the following syntax can be enabled via set_heed_colons():

    * Field-specific constructs, in the form of 'fieldname:termtext' or 
      'fieldname:(foo bar)'.  (The field specified by 'fieldname:' will be
      used instead of the QueryParser's default fields).

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new( I<[labeled params]> )

    my $query_parser = KinoSearch::QueryParser->new(
        schema         => $searcher->get_schema,    # required
        analyzer       => $analyzer,                # overrides schema
        fields         => ['bodytext'],             # default: indexed fields
        default_boolop => 'AND',                    # default: 'OR'
    );

Constructor.

=over

=item *

B<schema> - A L<Schema|KinoSearch::Schema>.

=item *

B<analyzer> - An L<Analyzer|KinoSearch::Analysis::Analyzer>.
Ordinarily, the analyzers specified by each field's definition will be
used, but if C<analyzer> is supplied, it will override and be used for
all fields.  This can lead to mismatches between what is in the index
and what is being searched for, so use caution.

=item *

B<fields> - The names of the fields which will be searched against.
Defaults to those fields which are defined as indexed in the supplied
Schema.

=item *

B<default_boolop> - Two possible values: 'AND' and 'OR'.  The default
is 'OR', which means: return documents which match any of the query
terms.  If you want only documents which match all of the query terms,
set this to 'AND'.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 parse(query_string)

Build a Query object from the contents of a query string.  At present,
implemented internally by calling tree(), expand(), and prune().

=over

=item *

B<query_string> - The string to be parsed.  May be undef.

=back

Returns: a Query.

=head2 tree(query_string)

Parse the logical structure of a query string, building a tree
comprised of Query objects.  Leaf nodes in the tree will most often be
LeafQuery objects but might be MatchAllQuery or NoMatchQuery objects as
well.  Internal nodes will be objects which subclass PolyQuery:
ANDQuery, ORQuery, NOTQuery, and RequiredOptionalQuery.

The output of tree() is an intermediate form which must be passed
through expand() before being used to feed a search.

=over

=item *

B<query_string> - The string to be parsed.

=back

Returns: a Query.

=head2 expand(query)

Walk the hierarchy of a Query tree, descending through all PolyQuery
nodes and calling expand_leaf() on any LeafQuery nodes encountered.

=over

=item *

B<query> - A Query object.

=back

Returns: A Query -- usually the same one that was supplied after
in-place modification, but possibly another.

=head2 expand_leaf(query)

Convert a LeafQuery into either a TermQuery, a PhraseQuery, or an
ORQuery joining multiple TermQueries/PhraseQueries to accommodate
multiple fields.  LeafQuery text will be passed through the relevant
Analyzer for each field.  Quoted text will be transformed into
PhraseQuery objects.  Unquoted text will be converted to either a
TermQuery or a PhraseQuery depending on how many tokens are generated.

=over

=item *

B<query> - A Query.  Only LeafQuery objects will be processed; others
will be passed through.

=back

Returns: A Query.

=head2 prune(query)

Prevent certain Query structures from returning too many results.
Query objects built via tree() and expand() can generate "return the
world" result sets, such as in the case of
C<< NOT a_term_not_in_the_index >>; prune() walks the hierarchy
and eliminates such branches.  

     'NOT foo'               => [NOMATCH]
     'foo OR NOT bar'        => 'foo'
     'foo OR (-bar AND -baz) => 'foo'

prune() also eliminates some double-negative constructs -- even though 
such constructs may not actually return the world:

     'foo AND -(-bar)'      => 'foo'

In this example, safety is taking precedence over logical consistency.
If you want logical consistency instead, call tree() then expand(),
skipping prune().

=over

=item *

B<query> - A Query.

=back

Returns: a Query; in most cases, the supplied Query after in-place
modification.

=head2 set_heed_colons(heed_colons)

Enable/disable parsing of C<< fieldname:foo >> constructs.

=head2 make_term_query( I<[labeled params]> )

Factory method creating a TermQuery.

=over

=item *

B<field> - Field name.

=item *

B<term> - Term text.

=back

Returns: A Query.

=head2 make_phrase_query( I<[labeled params]> )

Factory method creating a PhraseQuery.

=over

=item *

B<field> - Field that the phrase must occur in.

=item *

B<terms> - Ordered array of terms that must match.

=back

Returns: A Query.

=head2 make_and_query(children)

Factory method creating an ANDQuery.

=over

=item *

B<children> - Array of child Queries.

=back

Returns: A Query.

=head2 make_or_query(children)

Factory method creating an ORQuery.

=over

=item *

B<children> - Array of child Queries.

=back

Returns: A Query.

=head2 make_not_query(negated_query)

Factory method creating a NOTQuery.

=over

=item *

B<negated_query> - Query to be inverted.

=back

Returns: A Query.

=head2 make_req_opt_query( I<[labeled params]> )

Factory method creating a RequiredOptionalQuery.

=over

=item *

B<required_query> - Query must must match.

=item *

B<optional_query> - Query which should match.

=back

Returns: A Query.

KinoSearch::Search::Hits - Access search results.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $hits = $searcher->hits(
        query      => $query,
        offset     => 0,
        num_wanted => 10,
    );
    while ( my $hit = $hits->next ) {
        print "<p>$hit->{title} <em>" . $hit->get_score . "</em></p>\n";
    }



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hits objects are iterators used to access the results of a search.





=head1 METHODS

=head2 next()

Return the next hit, or undef when the iterator is exhausted.

=head2 total_hits()

Return the total number of documents which matched the Query used to
produce the Hits object.  Note that this is the total number of
matches, not just the number of matches represented by the Hits
iterator.

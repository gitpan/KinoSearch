=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Search::Similarity - Calculate how closely two things match.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MySimilarity;
    
    sub length_norm { 
        my ( $self, $num_tokens ) = @_;
        return $num_tokens == 0 ? 1 : log($num_tokens) + 1;
    }
    
    package MyFullTextType;
    use base qw( KinoSearch::FieldType::FullTextType );
    
    sub similarity { MySimilarity->new }



=head1 DESCRIPTION

After determining whether a document matches a given query, a score must be
calculated which indicates how I<well> the document matches the query.  The
Similarity class is used to judge how "similar" the query and the document
are to each other; the closer the resemblance, they higher the document
scores.

The default implementation uses Lucene's modified cosine similarity
measure.  Subclasses might tweak the existing algorithms, or might be used
in conjunction with custom Query subclasses to implement arbitrary scoring
schemes.

Most of the methods operate on single fields, but some are used to combine
scores from multiple fields.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new()

    my $sim = KinoSearch::Search::Similarity->new;

Constructor. Takes no arguments.



=head1 METHODS

=head2 length_norm(num_tokens)

Dampen the scores of long documents.

After a field is broken up into terms at index-time, each term must be
assigned a weight.  One of the factors in calculating this weight is
the number of tokens that the original field was broken into.

Typically, we assume that the more tokens in a field, the less
important any one of them is -- so that, e.g. 5 mentions of "Kafka" in
a short article are given more heft than 5 mentions of "Kafka" in an
entire book.  The default implementation of length_norm expresses this
using an inverted square root.  

However, the inverted square root has a tendency to reward very short
fields highly, which isn't always appropriate for fields you expect to
have a lot of tokens on average.

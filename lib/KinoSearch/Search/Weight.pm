=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Search::Weight - Searcher-dependent transformation of a Query

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # abstract base class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In one sense, a Weight is the weight of a Query object.  Conceptually, a
Query's "weight" ought to be a single number: a co-efficient... and indeed,
eventually a Weight object gets turned into a $weight_value.

However, since calculating that multiplier is rather complex, the calculations
are encapsulated within a class.

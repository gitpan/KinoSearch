=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Store::Folder - Abstract class representing a directory.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Abstract base class.



=head1 DESCRIPTION

The archetypal implementation of Folder,
L<FSFolder|KinoSearch::Store::FSFolder>, is a single directory on the file
system holding a collection of files.  However, to allow alternative
implementations such as RAMFolder, i/o and file manipulation are abstracted
out rather than executed directly by KinoSearch's classes.

A "file" within an folder might be a real file on disk -- or it might be a
ram file.  Similarly, delete() might delete a file from the file system, or
a key-value pair from a hash, or something else.







=head1 INHERITANCE

KinoSearch::Store::Folder isa L<KinoSearch::Obj>.

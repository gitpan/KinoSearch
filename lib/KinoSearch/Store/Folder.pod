=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Store::Folder - Abstract class representing a directory.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Abstract base class.



=head1 DESCRIPTION

A "file" within a Folder might be a real file on disk -- or it might be a
RAM buffer.  Similarly, delete() might delete a file from the file system, or
a key-value pair from a hash, or something else.  

The archetypal implementation of Folder,
L<FSFolder|KinoSearch::Store::FSFolder>, represents a directory on
the file system holding a collection of files.







=head1 INHERITANCE

KinoSearch::Store::Folder isa L<KinoSearch::Object::Obj>.

=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Store::RAMFolder - In-memory Folder implementation.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $folder = KinoSearch::Store::RAMFolder->new;
    
    # or sometimes...
    my $folder = KinoSearch::Store::RAMFolder->new(
        path   => '/path/to/folder',
    );



=head1 DESCRIPTION

RAMFolder is an entirely in-memory implementation of
KinoSearch::Store::Folder.  It serves two main purposes.

First, it's possible to load an existing FSFolder into memory, which can
improve search-speed -- if you have that kind of RAM to spare.  Needless to
say, any FSFolder you try to load this way should be appropriately modest in
size.

Second, RAMFolder is handy for testing and development.
